The 2048 game uses arrow keys and merge the same number in order to get points.
For chapter 2 the story is 1-2 pages so it's short, please note that this is not broken the story is just SHORT.
Also it is not broken for the 2048 and platformer but if it shows weird on your side i am sorry to hear that please go to my other public repos to see how it looks like on my screen. The other is called NOT BROKEN.
